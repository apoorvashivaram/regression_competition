Repo for submission to STAT 301-3 Regression Competition

# file organization
Folders `set_1`, `set_2`, and `set_3` contain model setup files and tuning scripts for three sets of recipes for the kaggle competition. Each folder also contains a `kaggle_submission` folder that contains the predictions that were submitted to the kaggle competition. 

The random forest models from sets 1 and 3 were the final submissions for the kaggle competition.
